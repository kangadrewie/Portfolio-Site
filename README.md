This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Personal Portfolio

Personal Portfolio website created with ReactJS. When I started this project, I wanted to create a hub for all my work. To achieve this I needed to build in a Project Showcase that would allow a user to access my source files for my work. Using GitHub api, I built a file explorer that makes requests to me latest Github commit and returns the content, without asking the user to leave the page.
